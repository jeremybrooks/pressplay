PressPlay makes it easy to play media from Java using the ffmpeg tools. 

Requirements:
ffmpeg must be installed on the machine where you want to play media.
Java 11 or higher is required.

Add the jar to your project. You can use this dependency:
TODO

If the ffmpeg tools are not installed at /usr/local/bin, you will need to set a system property:
pressplay.ffmpeg.path=/full/path/to/tools/
